# A Pong game with SDL2 and C++

This is just a test, because I wanted to know how CMake works, while also doing a little project.

So in the end, I decided to make pong using SDL2 and C++.

The game is not finished, I just did the bare minimum to see the compiling process with CMake working.

# How to build

On the project's main folder:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
